# Backend with Nodejs (Week 4 - workshop code)

This is the code used in Workshop 4 in the Backend with Nodejs course.

## Here is how it is structured:

You will see the folders or directories are being ordered as demonstrated in the workshop.
This is the finished code for each part.

You should do the following to start the server for any of the directories/sections:
1. You need to install the dependencies first, make sure you are in the right path first: `npm install`
2. You need to start the MongoDB server locally if it uses it (except the mongo-atlas project) using the following command: `mongod --dbpath=data` (make sure MongoDB is installed and data directory exists).
3. You can start the server: `npm start`
4. For the facebook-login, make sure to follow instructions to create the app and add the email permission to it and update public/index.html and config.js files.

That's it.
